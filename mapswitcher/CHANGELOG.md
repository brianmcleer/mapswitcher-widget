# Changelog

Newest first. Every release bumps `manifest.json` and `package.json` together.

## 1.0.2 (2026-09-17)

- Packaging: the Visual Studio editor shims are no longer in the release zip. `publish.ps1` strips them from a staging copy (`$ReleaseOnlyExclude`) and refuses to zip if any ambient `declare module` of react, jimu or esri survives. The shims stay in the GitHub repo; clone users delete them before building.
- Editor: widget-level `tsconfig.json` moved to the self-contained mode B setup for Experience Builder 1.21 (pnpm): no `paths`, `"types": []`, master `src/exb-editor-shims.d.ts` copied from `widgets\_vs`, widget-specific declarations in `src/vendor-shims.d.ts`. `npx tsc -p .` reports 0 errors. Webpack output is unchanged (jsx settings kept).
